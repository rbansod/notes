Question: What is the difference between the == operator and the equals() method in Java?
Answer: The == operator compares object references, while the equals() method compares the content or state of objects for equality.

Question: Explain the difference between method overloading and method overriding in Java.
Answer: Method overloading involves defining multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameter lists, while method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.

Question: What are access modifiers in Java, and what is their significance?
Answer: Access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected, default) control the visibility and accessibility of classes, methods, and variables. They help enforce encapsulation and ensure proper data hiding and abstraction.

Question: What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java, and how is it used?
Answer: The static keyword in Java is used to create class-level variables and methods that are shared among all instances of the class. Static members are associated with the class rather than with any specific instance.

Question: How does exception handling work in Java, and what are the different types of exceptions?
Answer: Exception handling in Java involves detecting, propagating, and handling exceptions using try-catch blocks. Exceptions in Java are divided into two categories: checked exceptions (which must be either caught or declared) and unchecked exceptions (which do not need to be declared).

Question: What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java, and where can it be applied?
Answer: The final keyword in Java is used to create constants, prevent inheritance, and make methods or variables immutable. It can be applied to variables, methods, and classes.

Question: How are strings represented in Java, and what is the difference between String and StringBuilder?
Answer: Strings in Java are immutable and represented as objects of the String class. StringBuilder is mutable and used for efficient string manipulation, especially in scenarios involving frequent concatenation.

Question: What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java?
Answer: An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods and can contain state (fields), while an interface can only have abstract methods and cannot contain state.

Question: How does Java support multiple inheritance, and what are the limitations?
Answer: Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces, which allow a class to implement multiple interfaces but extend only one class. This avoids the problems associated with multiple inheritance in languages like C++.

Question: Explain the concept of autoboxing and unboxing in Java.
Answer: Autoboxing is the automatic conversion of primitive types to their corresponding wrapper classes, and unboxing is the automatic conversion of wrapper classes to their corresponding primitive types.

Question: Discuss the difference between the ArrayList and LinkedList classes in Java.
Answer: ArrayList is implemented as a dynamic array and provides fast random access but slower insertion and deletion, while LinkedList is implemented as a doubly linked list and provides fast insertion and deletion but slower random access.

Question: What is the purpose of the this keyword in Java, and when would you use it?
Answer: The this keyword refers to the current object within a class and is used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name, invoke other constructors, and pass the current object as a parameter.

Question: How does Java handle memory management, and what is garbage collection?
Answer: Java uses automatic memory management through garbage collection, which involves reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable by the application.

Question: Explain the concept of encapsulation in Java, and why is it important?
Answer: Encapsulation refers to bundling data (attributes) and methods (behavior) together within a class and protecting them from external interference. It helps maintain data integrity, promotes code reusability, and reduces dependencies between classes.

Question: What are constructors in Java, and how are they different from regular methods?
Answer: Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects and have the same name as the class. They do not have a return type and are called automatically when an object is created using the new keyword.

Question: How does Java support polymorphism, and what are the different types?
Answer: Java supports polymorphism through method overloading (compile-time polymorphism) and method overriding (runtime polymorphism). Method overriding is achieved by subclassing and providing a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the superclass.

Question: What is the super keyword in Java, and when would you use it?
Answer: The super keyword refers to the superclass of the current object and is used to access superclass methods, fields, and constructors. It is typically used to invoke superclass constructors or methods from within a subclass.

Question: Discuss the differences between the HashMap and HashTable classes in Java.
Answer: HashMap is not thread-safe and allows null keys and values, while HashTable is synchronized and does not allow null keys or values. HashMap is preferred for single-threaded environments, while HashTable is suitable for multi-threaded environments.

Question: What is the purpose of the instanceof operator in Java, and how is it used?
Answer: The instanceof operator is used to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or interface. It returns true if the object is an instance of the specified type or a subtype, and false otherwise.

Question: How does Java support multithreading, and what are the different synchronization mechanisms available?
Answer: Java supports multithreading through the Thread class and the Runnable interface. Synchronization mechanisms such as synchronized blocks, intrinsic locks, and explicit locks (e.g., ReentrantLock) are used to coordinate access to shared resources and prevent data races.

These answers provide a comprehensive understanding of the concepts covered by the moderate-level Java interview questions. Feel free to ask if you have any further questions or need clarification on any topic!
